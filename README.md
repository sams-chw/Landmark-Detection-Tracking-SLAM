# Landmark-Detection-Tracking (SLAM)

In this third project of CVND-Udacity, I have implemented SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) for a 2 dimensional world. SLAM is a technique to track the location of a robot in the world in real-time and identify the locations of landmarks such as buildings, trees, rocks, and other world features based on sensor measurements.
