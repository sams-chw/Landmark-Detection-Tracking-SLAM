# Landmark-Detection-Tracking (SLAM)

In this third project of CVND-Udacity, I have implemented Graph SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) for a two-dimensional world for tracking the location of a robot in the world in real-time and identifying the locations of landmarks such as buildings, trees, rocks, and other world features based on robot's sensor measurements and motion over time.
